# üçÖ Pomodoro
A simples bash service to run working cycles.

## Installation
Just copy the `pomodoro` file and put in your path.
A suitable alternative is the .local folder under the home path.
``` bash
$ mkdir -p $HOME/.local/bin
$ cp pomodoro $HOME/.local/bin/

```

You may want to add this last export to your bashrc or bash profile to make it
available in every sessio.
